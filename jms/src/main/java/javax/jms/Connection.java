/** A <CODE>Connection</CODE> object is a client's active connection to its JMS 
  * provider. It typically allocates provider resources outside the Java virtual
  * machine (JVM).
  *
  * <P>Connections support concurrent use.
  *
  * <P>A connection serves several purposes:
  *
  * <UL>
  *   <LI>It encapsulates an open connection with a JMS provider. It 
  *       typically represents an open TCP/IP socket between a client and 
  *       the service provider software.
  *   <LI>Its creation is where client authentication takes place.
  *   <LI>It can specify a unique client identifier.
  *   <LI>It provides a <CODE>ConnectionMetaData</CODE> object.
  *   <LI>It supports an optional <CODE>ExceptionListener</CODE> object.
  * </UL>
  *
  * <P>Because the creation of a connection involves setting up authentication 
  * and communication, a connection is a relatively heavyweight 
  * object. Most clients will do all their messaging with a single connection.
  * Other more advanced applications may use several connections. The JMS API
  * does 
  * not architect a reason for using multiple connections; however, there may 
  * be operational reasons for doing so.
  *
  * <P>A JMS client typically creates a connection, one or more sessions, 
  * and a number of message producers and consumers. When a connection is
  * created, it is in stopped mode. That means that no messages are being
  * delivered.
  *
  * <P>It is typical to leave the connection in stopped mode until setup 
  * is complete (that is, until all message consumers have been 
  * created).  At that point, the client calls 
  * the connection's <CODE>start</CODE> method, and messages begin arriving at 
  * the connection's consumers. This setup
  * convention minimizes any client confusion that may result from 
  * asynchronous message delivery while the client is still in the process 
  * of setting itself up.
  *
  * <P>A connection can be started immediately, and the setup can be done 
  * afterwards. Clients that do this must be prepared to handle asynchronous 
  * message delivery while they are still in the process of setting up.
  *
  * <P>A message producer can send messages while a connection is stopped.
