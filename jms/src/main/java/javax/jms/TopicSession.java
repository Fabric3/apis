/** A <CODE>TopicSession</CODE> object provides methods for creating 
  * <CODE>TopicPublisher</CODE>, <CODE>TopicSubscriber</CODE>, and 
  * <CODE>TemporaryTopic</CODE> objects. It also provides a method for 
  * deleting its client's durable subscribers.
  *
  *<P>A <CODE>TopicSession</CODE> is used for creating Pub/Sub specific
  * objects. In general, use the  <CODE>Session</CODE> object, and 
  *  use <CODE>TopicSession</CODE>  only to support
  * existing code. Using the <CODE>Session</CODE> object simplifies the 
  * programming model, and allows transactions to be used across the two 
  * messaging domains.
  * 
  * <P>A <CODE>TopicSession</CODE> cannot be used to create objects specific to the 
  * point-to-point domain. The following methods inherit from 
  * <CODE>Session</CODE>, but must throw an 
  * <CODE>IllegalStateException</CODE> 
  * if used from <CODE>TopicSession</CODE>:
  *<UL>
  *   <LI><CODE>createBrowser</CODE>
  *   <LI><CODE>createQueue</CODE>
  *   <LI><CODE>createTemporaryQueue</CODE>
