/**
 * Applications use a TimerManager to schedule TimerListeners.   
 * Each of the TimerManager schedule methods returns a Timer object.  
 * The returned Timer can then be queried and/or cancelled.  Applications 
 * are required to implement the TimerListener interface and may optionally 
 * implement one or both of the CancelTimerListener and StopTimerListener interfaces.
 *  
 * All Timers execute in the same JVM as the thread that created
 * the Timer and are transient.  If the JVM fails then all Timers will be lost.<p>
 * 
 * TimerManagers are bound to a J2EE component using a resource-reference, similar
 * to a WorkManager or DataSource. Each lookup returns a new logical TimerManager who's
 * lifecycle can be managed independently of all other TimerManagers. Components should 
 * cache the TimerManager rather than look it up every time.<p>
 * 
 * All TimerManagers are bound to the lifecycle of the application that looks it up.
 * When the application state changes, all TimerManagers associated with that
 * application will be stopped, suspended or resumed, depending on the capabilities
 * of the application server. 
 * 
 * TimerManagers are configured by the server administrator.  
 * The vendor specific systems management console allows the administrator to create one or more TimerManagers and associate
 * a JNDI name with each one. The administrator may specify implementation specific information such as
 * the maximum number of concurrent timers or thread priorities for each TimerManager. An application that requires a TimerManager
 * should declare a resource-ref in the EJB or webapp that needs the TimerManager. The vendor descriptor editor or
 * J2EE IDE can be used to bind this resource-ref to a physical TimerManager at
 * deploy or development time. An EJB or servlet can then get a reference to
 * a TimerManager by looking up the resource-ref name in JNDI and then casting it. For example, if the resource-ref was called tm/TimerManager:
 * <pre>
 * &lt;resource-ref&gt;
 *   &lt;res-ref-name&gt;tm/TimerManager&lt;/res-ref-name&gt;
 *   &lt;res-type&gt;commonj.timers.TimerManager&lt;/res-type&gt;
 *   &lt;res-auth&gt;Container&lt;/res-auth&gt;
 *   &lt;res-sharing-scope&gt;Unshareable&lt;/res-sharing-scope&gt;
 * &lt;/resource-ref&gt;
 * </pre>
 * The res-auth is ignored in this version of the specification. The sharing scope must be set to unshareable. If this is specified as shareable then a vendor specific action will occur. The Java code to look this up would look like:
 * <pre>
 *   InitialContext ic = new InitialContext();
 *   TimerManager tm = (TimerManager)ic.lookup("java:comp/env/tm/TimerManager");
 * </pre>
 * The EJB or servlet can then use the TimerManager as it needs to.<p>

 * Recurring timers will execute their TimerListener multiple times.  
 * Invocations of the TimerListener are executed serially.  That is, 
 * if a timer is scheduled to repeat every 5 seconds and a previous 
 * execution is still running, then the subsequent execution is delayed 
 * until the currently running execution completes.<p>
 * 
 * A TimerListener scheduled multiple times, resulting in the return of multiple Timer instances, 
 * may execute concurrently depending on implementation. Proper thread safety techniques 
 * need to be employed.<p>
 * 
 * When a TimerListener is scheduled, the declared context that is present on the thread 
 * (the J2EE context) will be saved and propagated to the asynchronous methods that are 
 * executed.  This J2EE context at minimum will contain the java:comp namespace and 
 * ClassLoader of the scheduler unless specified otherwise.  Other J2EE contexts such as 
 * security or a transactional context may be optionally added by the application server vendor.  
 * Global transactions are always available using the java:comp/UserTransaction JNDI 
 * name and are used in the same fashion as they are used in servlets and bean-managed 
 * transaction Enterprise Java Beans.<p> 
 * 
 * Two types of repeating timers are available:
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>fixed-rate</strong> - 
 * TimerListeners are executed at a constant rate based on the 
 * initial scheduled execution time.  Each subsequent execution time is based off of the period
 * and the first execution time.  This is appropriate for recurring 
 * activities that are sensitive to absolute time, such as ringing a chime
 * every hour on the hour.  It is also appropriate for recurring activities 
 * where the total time to perform a fixed number of executions is important, such
 * as a countdown timer that ticks once every second for ten seconds.<br><br>
 * 
 * If a fixed-rate execution is delayed for any reason (such as garbage collection, 
 * suspension, or other background activity), 
 * the late TimerListener will execute one time immediately, and then again at the next 
 * scheduled fixed-rate time.<br><br>
 *
 * For example, if a fixed-rate timer was to execute every hour on the hour 
 * and missed 5 executions because the TimerManager was suspended for over 
 * 5 hours,  when the TimerManager is resumed, the TimerListener will 
 * run once immedately, and each execution thereafter will be on the hour.<p>
 *  
 * <li><strong>fixed-delay</strong> - 
 * TimerListeners are executed at a constant delay based on the
 * actual execution time.  Each subsequent execution time is based off of the period 
 * and the end time of the previous execution.  The period is the delay in between 
 * TimerListener executions.<br><br>
 * 
 * If a fixed-delay execution is delayed for any reason (such as garbage collection, 
 * suspension, or other background activity), subsequent executions will be delayed as well. In the 
 * long run, the frequency of execution will generally be slightly lower than the 
 * reciprocal of the specified period (assuming the system clock underlying 
 * Object.wait(long) is accurate). Fixed-delay execution is appropriate for 
 * recurring activities that require &quot;smoothness&quot;. In other words, it is appropriate for 
 * activities where it is more important to keep the frequency accurate in the short run 
 * than in the long run. This includes most animation tasks, such as blinking a cursor 
 * at regular intervals. It also includes tasks wherein regular activity is performed 
 * in response to human input, such as automatically repeating a character as long as 
 * a key is held down.<p>
 *
 * For example, if a fixed-delay timer was to execute every hour on the hour 
 * and missed 5 executions because the TimerManager was suspended for over 
 * 5 hours,  when the TimerManager is resumed, the TimerListener would execute
 * immediately and the next execution would occur one hour after the completion 
 * of the TimerListener.
 * </ul>
