/**
 * If a Work instance is serializable and the WorkManager implementation supports Remoteable
 * WorkManager then the Work can be sent to a remote member of the application cluster for execution. 
 * This allows serializable Works to be executed on any member of the J2EE cluster containing the application. Subsequent scheduleWork
 * calls will result in the Works being load balanced over the available members in the cluster using a vendor specific algorithm. <p>
 * Clearly, if this is the case then the Work object supplied to scheduleWork cannot be used to interrogate the result when the
 * Work completes as it was a copy that was executed on the remote JVM. The Work instance is copied and marshalled to the remote JVM 
 * where it is executed and then a copy
 * of the Work instance is send back to the JVM that called scheduleWork. This returned copy is then available using the
 * {@link WorkItem#getResult()} method.<p>
 * 
 * If the application wants to send multiple Work objects to the same remote JVM then it 
 * should schedule Work on a resource-ref obtained WorkManager and then
 * schedule subsequent Work objects using the WorkManager obtained from the 
 * {@link RemoteWorkItem#getPinnedWorkManager} method. This is called a pinned WorkManager.
 * This provides affinity to the same remote JVM to be maintained. 
 * If the remote JVM fails then subsequent calls to scheduleWork on the pinned
 * WorkManager will fail with a {@link WorkRejectedException} once the failure has been detected.<p>
 * 
 * If a remote JVM containing pending Works fails then these Works are marked as complete with a status of rejected. 
 * @since 1.0

	 * just after getStatus returns 'still working'.
