/**
 * The WorkManager is the abstraction for dispatching and monitoring asynchronous
 * work and is a factory for creating application short or long lived Works.
 * <p> 
 * WorkManagers are created by the server administrator.  
 * The vendor specific systems management console allows the administrator to create one or more WorkManagers and associate
 * a JNDI name with each one. The administrator may specify implementation specific information such as
 * min/max Works for each WorkManager. An application that requires a WorkManager
 * should declare a resource-ref in the EJB or webapp that needs the WorkManager. The vendor descriptor editor or
 * J2EE IDE can be used to bind this resource-ref to a physical WorkManager at
 * deploy or development time. An EJB or servlet can then get a reference to
 * a WorkManager by looking up the resource-ref name in JNDI and then casting it. For example, if the resource-ref was called wm/WorkManager:
 * <pre>
 * &lt;resource-ref&gt;
 *   &lt;res-ref-name&gt;wm/WorkManager&lt;/res-ref-name&gt;
 *   &lt;res-type&gt;commonj.work.WorkManager&lt;/res-type&gt;
 *   &lt;res-auth&gt;Container&lt;/res-auth&gt;
 *   &lt;res-sharing-scope&gt;Shareable&lt;/res-sharing-scope&gt;
 * &lt;/resource-ref&gt;
 * </pre>
 * The Java code to look this up would look like:
 * <pre>
 *   InitialContext ic = new InitialContext();
 *   WorkManager wm = (WorkManager)ic.lookup("java:comp/env/wm/WorkManager");
 * </pre>
 * The res-auth and res-sharing scopes are ignored in this version of the specification.
 * The EJB or servlet can then use the WorkManager as it needs to.<p>
 * 
 * When a Work is scheduled, the declared context that is present on the thread 
 * (the J2EE context) will be saved and propagated to the asynchronous methods that 
 * are executed.  This J2EE context at minimum will contain the java:comp namespace 
 * and ClassLoader of the scheduler unless specified otherwise.  Other J2EE contexts 
 * such as security or a transactional context may be optionally added by the application 
 * server vendor.  Global transactions are always available using the 
 * java:comp/UserTransaction JNDI name and are used in the same fashion as they are used 
 * in servlets and bean-managed transaction Enterprise Java Beans.<p>
 * 
 * A WorkManager can also be a pinned WorkManager. This is a WorkManager obtained using the RemoteWorkItem.getWorkManager
 * method. This allows subsequent scheduleWorks to be send to the same remote WorkManager as the one that is associated
 * with the RemoteWorkItem. Pinned WorkManagers are only supported on vendor implementations that support remote Works. However,
 * applications that follow the programming model will work on all implementations however serializable Works will be
 * executed within the local JVM only on those implementations.<p>
 * 
 * If the scheduled <code>Work</code> is a daemon Work, then the life-cycle of that Work is tied to 
 * the application that scheduled it.  If the application is stopped, the <code>Work.release()</code> method
 * will be called.<p>
