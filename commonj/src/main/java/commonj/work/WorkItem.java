 * This is returned once a Work is submitted to a WorkManager.
 * It can be used to check the status of Work after it's finished and to
 * check any exceptions that it threw. If the Work was serializable and
 * the vendor implementation supports distributed WorkManagers then this
 * object can be cast to RemoteWorkItem where additional APIs are defined
 * to exploit this capability. WorkItem instances can also be used with the
 * {@link WorkManager#waitForAny} or {@link WorkManager#waitForAll} to wait
 * for remote or local WorkItems to complete.<p>
 * 
 * Applications can use the WorkItem as a key to correlate the WorkItem back 
 * to the running Work object.  The WorkItem should implement the equals, compareTo 
 * and hashCode methods and is therefore Collection-friendly.
