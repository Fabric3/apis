/**
 * This is implemented by applications when they want to run
 * code blocks asynchronously. If an application supplied Work implements
 * java.io.Serializable then this tells the runtime that the application will
 * not interact with the Work directly while it is running. The runtime may decide
 * in this case to dispatch the Work in a seperate JVM that also hosts this application. Obviously, if this happens
 * then the Work will be serialized to the remote JVM, executed and the results 
 * propagated back. The WorkItem API will work correctly in this case. However,
 * the application cannot in this case interrogate the local Work supplied to scheduleWork
 * for results as it wasn't executed, a copy would have been executed remotely. The
 * {@link RemoteWorkItem#getResult} method will return the copy in this case.<p>
 * If the Work does not implement Serializable then it is guaranteed to execute in
 * the same JVM as the thread invoking WorkManager.startWork.<p>
 * If the server is quiescing then the runtime may call the release method on the
 * Work once it starts executing to tell it to exit. If it doesn't respond to this
 * 'signal' then it may be terminated by the runtime without warning.<p>
 * 
 * The J2EE context active on the thread during WorkManager scheduling 
 * will be applied to the <code>run</code> method.  See {@link WorkManager} for details.
